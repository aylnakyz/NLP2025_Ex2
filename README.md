This repository contains the code and implementation for a character-level language model using the US Cities Dataset. The model is trained to predict the next character based on a sequence of previous characters. The dataset used is a free version of the US Cities Database provided by Simplemaps. This model is built from A. Karpathy's codes to demonstrate the application of character-level language modeling on us city names.
